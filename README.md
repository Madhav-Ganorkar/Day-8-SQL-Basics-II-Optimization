# ðŸ’¡ SQL Implementation Exercises: Core Concepts for Interviews

This project covers five key SQL tasks every data professional should know. Each task is implemented and explained in terms of what it is, why it's used, and where it applies in real life.

## âœ… 1. Normalize a Denormalized Table into 3NF

### ðŸ“Œ What It Means:
Normalization is the process of structuring a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. 3NF (Third Normal Form) ensures that:
- Each column is atomic (1NF),
- There are no partial dependencies (2NF),
- There are no transitive dependencies (3NF).

### ðŸ“š Why Itâ€™s Important:
- Prevents data duplication
- Makes updates and deletions safer and easier
- Reduces storage space

### ðŸ›  Use Case:
Useful in systems like e-commerce, CRM, or ERPs where customer/product/order data gets repeated.

---

## âœ… 2. Create and Query a Materialized View

### ðŸ“Œ What It Means:
A materialized view is a stored snapshot of the result of a query. Unlike a normal view (which fetches fresh data), a materialized view stores results physically and can be refreshed periodically.

### ðŸ“š Why Itâ€™s Important:
- Boosts performance for slow or complex queries
- Ideal for reporting dashboards and analytics

### ðŸ›  Use Case:
You can use it to store pre-calculated top-selling products or monthly revenue summaries for fast reporting.

---

## âœ… 3. Stored Procedure for a Common Data Operation

### ðŸ“Œ What It Means:
A stored procedure is a saved set of SQL statements that you can run with a single command. It accepts parameters and performs repeatable logic like inserts, updates, or validations.

### ðŸ“š Why Itâ€™s Important:
- Reduces code repetition
- Improves security and consistency
- Simplifies application logic

### ðŸ›  Use Case:
Can be used to automate operations like adding new customers, updating orders, or archiving logs.

---

## âœ… 4. Analyze an `EXPLAIN` Plan and Add Indexes

### ðŸ“Œ What It Means:
The `EXPLAIN` statement tells you how MySQL plans to execute a query â€” which indexes it will use, what order of access it follows, and how many rows it expects to scan.

Adding indexes helps MySQL locate data faster, just like an index in a book.

### ðŸ“š Why Itâ€™s Important:
- Makes slow queries faster
- Helps diagnose performance bottlenecks

### ðŸ›  Use Case:
Used during performance tuning when queries are taking too long due to full table scans.

---

## âœ… 5. Partition a Large Table by Range or Hash

### ðŸ“Œ What It Means:
Partitioning splits a large table into smaller parts (partitions) to make queries faster and storage more efficient. 
- **Range partitioning** splits data based on a range (like date or amount).
- **Hash partitioning** splits data randomly using a hash function.

### ðŸ“š Why Itâ€™s Important:
- Improves query performance on large tables
- Helps with easier data archiving and maintenance

### ðŸ›  Use Case:
Used in large systems like logs, sales data, or audit tables where millions of rows are queried daily.

## ðŸ”š Conclusion

These five SQL implementations are essential tools in the skillset of any data engineer or analyst. They help build structured, high-performance, and maintainable databases that scale with your data.
